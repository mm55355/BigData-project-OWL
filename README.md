# BigData-project-OWL

This repository contains three computer vision models that can be used for different tasks. 

## Car Logo Detector 
This model uses a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect car logos in images. 
It can be used for tasks such as brand recognition or car logo identification.

## License Plate Detection Model with YOLOv8 
This model uses a custom YOLOv8 model to detect license plates in images. It can be used for tasks such as MOT information. 

## License Plate Detection Model with Roboflow 
This model uses the Roboflow platform to train a custom object detection model to detect license plates in images. 

## Requirements 
Each model has its own set of requirements, which are listed in the corresponding word file. 

## Acknowledgments - 
YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are based on the work of Joseph Redmon et al. and Alexey Bochkovskiy et al., respectively. - The Roboflow platform was used to train the license plate detection model.
